# Ionic (frontend) and NodeJs (backend) Example using Basic Authentication

This project is just a project example to learn how to use Basic Authentication in Ionic 5 (frontend) and NodeJS (backend) using Sequelize as ORM to access a MySQL database.

## Getting Started

Download links:

From Github: https://github.com/Lyks012/GameRating.git

Postman Endpoints : https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/18127118/UVRBo6my

## Prerequisites

You need a working environment with:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com) - You can install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) - You can install it from https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/es/download/. It's advisable to install the LTS version.

## General Installation instructions

The best option to start with this project is cloning it in your PC:

```
git clone https://github.com/Lyks012/GameRating.git
```

This project contains 2 different parts:

- Frontend
- Backend

You need a node.js working environment. The LTS is recommended: https://nodejs.org/es/

Once you have cloned the project install all dependencies.

```
cd frontend
npm install

cd backend
npm install
```

- For your backend part:

1. You need a backend/config/db.config.js file with  the data for the connection to your MySQL Server:

```

{
  HOST: "localhost",
  USER: "root",
  PASSWORD: "",
  DB: "video_games",
  dialect: "mysql",
  pool: {
    max: 5,
    min: 0,
    acquire: 30000,
    idle: 10000,
  },
}
```

2. You need a mysql server working.

3. Create the mysql database, that in our case is "video_games". You can import it from the file db_motorbikes_dev.sql included in this project. https://github.com/tcrurav/Ionic5NodeAuthBasic/blob/master/backend/db_motorbikes_dev.sql

Finally to start enjoying this project.

```
cd backend
npm start

cd frontend
ionic serve
```

Enjoy!!!
